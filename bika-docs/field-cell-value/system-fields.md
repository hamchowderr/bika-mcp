## Summary Table

| Field Type | Writable | Read (JSON) Type | Read (String) Type | Auto Updates |
|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| AutoNumber | ❌ No | number | string | On create only |
| Created Time | ❌ No | string (ISO 8601) | string (local) | On create only |
| Modified Time | ❌ No | string (ISO 8601) | string (local) | On every update |
| Created By | ❌ No | object | string (name) | On create only |
| Modified By | ❌ No | object | string (name) | On every update |

## Important Notes

### Read-Only Nature

All system fields are **read-only**. Attempting to write to them will result in an error or the values being ignored.

```json
// ❌ This will fail or be ignored
{
  "cells": {
    "AutoNumber": 100,
    "Created Time": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Automatic Timestamps

- **Created Time**: Set once when record is created
- **Modified Time**: Updated every time the record changes
- Both use ISO 8601 format in UTC
- String format converts to local timezone

### User Tracking

- **Created By**: Set to the user making the API call when creating
- **Modified By**: Updated to the user making the API call on each update
- Useful for audit trails and accountability

## Time Format Details

### ISO 8601 (JSON format)

```
"2023-09-01T08:00:00Z"
```

- Always in UTC timezone (Z suffix)
- Full date and time precision
- Suitable for programmatic use

### Local Time (String format)

```
"2023-09-01 16:00:00"
```

- Converted to local timezone
- Human-readable format
- For display purposes

## Use Cases

### AutoNumber
- **Tracking**: Sequential tracking of records
- **Referencing**: Easy reference to specific records
- **Sorting**: Natural ordering by creation sequence

### Created Time
- **Auditing**: When was this record added?
- **Reporting**: Records created in date range
- **Sorting**: Show newest/oldest records

### Modified Time
- **Change Tracking**: When was this last updated?
- **Freshness**: Identify stale records
- **Sync**: Determine what changed since last sync

### Created By
- **Accountability**: Who added this record?
- **Filtering**: Show only my created records
- **Ownership**: Identify record owners

### Modified By
- **Change Attribution**: Who made the last change?
- **Collaboration**: Track team member contributions
- **Support**: Contact person for questions

## Query Examples

### Filter by Creation Time

Get records created in the last 7 days:

```
Created Time > [7 days ago]
```

### Filter by Creator

Get records created by specific user:

```
Created By = "John Doe"
```

### Filter by Modified Time

Get recently updated records:

```
Modified Time > [24 hours ago]
```

### Sort by AutoNumber

Get records in creation order:

```
Sort by: AutoNumber ASC
```

## Best Practices

1. **Don't Try to Write**: Never attempt to set system field values
2. **Use for Filtering**: Leverage these fields for queries and filtering
3. **Audit Trails**: Use Created/Modified By for accountability
4. **Time-based Logic**: Use timestamps for time-based operations
5. **Display Formatting**: Use string format for user-facing displays
6. **Programmatic Use**: Use JSON format for calculations and comparisons

## Integration Example

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```typescript
interface SystemFields {
  AutoNumber?: number;
  'Created Time'?: string;
  'Modified Time'?: string;
  'Created By'?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  'Modified By'?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}

// Reading system fields
const record = await getRecord(spaceId, nodeId, recordId);

console.log('Record #', record.cells.AutoNumber);
console.log('Created:', new Date(record.cells['Created Time']));
console.log('Last modified:', new Date(record.cells['Modified Time']));
console.log('Created by:', record.cells['Created By'].name);
console.log('Modified by:', record.cells['Modified By'].name);

// Calculate time since creation
const createdDate = new Date(record.cells['Created Time']);
const now = new Date();
const daysSinceCreation = Math.floor(
  (now.getTime() - createdDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
);
console.log(`Record is ${daysSinceCreation} days old`);
```
